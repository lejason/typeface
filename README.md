# Hello

Here is my messaging application. It was a little odd faking a psuedo BE but keeping things in the FE I opted to use both context and localstore to persist across tabs (but for sake of the interview, I want to be clear that I obviously understand none of this would be good design in the prod/real-world env). The application assumes some auth/rbac endpoint where you are `User1` (John Doe). The rest is hopefully pretty intutive. 

#### To Run 

Yarn 
```
yarn install && yarn start
```

Npm
```
npm install && npm start
```

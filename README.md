# Hello

Here is my messaging application. It was a little odd faking a psuedo BE but keeping things in the FE I opted to use both context and localstore (to persist across tabs). But for sake of the interview, I want to be clear that I obviously understand none of this would be good design in the prod/real-world env. 

#### To Run

```
yarn install && start
